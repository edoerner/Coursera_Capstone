Additionaly, we would also prefer locations **as close to city center as possible**, assuming that the first condition is met.\n\nWe will use what we have learned during this course to define a few most promissing neighborhoods based on the aforementioned criteria. Advantages of each area will then be clearly expressed so that the stakeholders can choose **the best possible final location**."

This is due to the sustainable size of the city, so we can define a radius from the city center instear of using the actual city neighborhoods.\n\nFollowing data sources will be needed to extract/generate the required information:\n* centers of candidate areas will be generated algorithmically and approximate addresses of centers of those areas will be obtained using **Google Maps API reverse geocoding**\n* number of bike shops and their type and location in every neighborhood will be obtained using **Foursquare API**\n* coordinate of Santiago center will be obtained using **Google Maps API geocoding** of well known Santiago location (Plaza de Armas, city main square)"

In order to convert between WGS84 spherical coordinate system (latitude/longitude degrees) and UTM Cartesian coordinate system (X/Y coordinates in  meters) specialized functions are created. \n\nOnce the grid is defined, the address of each candidate is obtained using Google Maps geocoding API."

It is a reasonable distance, so it will be some flexibility in choosing the location candidates. \n\nFrom the heatmap showing the density of Bars it can be seen that there exists some locations with very low Bar density (or not information at all). There exist very high density pockets just in Plaza \u00d1u\u00f1oa and to the north west. It could be recognized some low pockets of low Bar density to the **north-east and east from Plaza \u00d1u\u00f1oa**. \n\nIf only the Beer Bars are considered, the resulting map shows a much lower density, due to the fact that Beer Bars represent a subset of ~18% of all bars in Santiag, but it also indicates higher density of existing Beer bars directly in and west of Plaza \u00d1u\u00f1oa, with closest pockets of **low Beer bars density positioned north-west and east from desired center**.\n\nBased on this the analysis is focused on areas *north-west from Plaza \u00d1u\u00f1oa* - the center of the area of interest is moved and its size is reduced to have a radius of **2.5km**.

Also they are relatively close to Plaza \u00d1u\u00f1oa and well connected, those boroughs appear to justify further analysis.\n\nIn order to analyze this neighborhood, a more dense grid of location candidates is created, restricted to the new region of interest. The location candidates will be 100m appart. The number of Bars in vicinity (using a radius of 250 meters) and distance to closest Beer Bar is calculated for each location candidate. The locations are filtered keeping only locations with no more than two Bars in a radius of 250 meters and no Beer Bars in radius of 400 meters. Then the locations are **clustered** to create **centers of zones containing good locations**. Those zones, their centers and addresses will be the final result of our analysis. "

Highest concentration of Bars was detected just in and west from Plaza \u00d1u\u00f1oa, so the analysis was focused to areas north and north-west, corresponding to the borough of Providencia. Providencia offers a combination of popularity among tourists, closeness to Plaza \u00d1u\u00f1oa, strong socio-economic dynamics *and* and significant areas of low Bar density.\n\nAfter directing the analysis to this more narrow area of interest (covering approx. 5x5km north-west from Plaza \u00d1u\u00f1oa) it was first created a dense grid of location candidates (spaced 100m appart); those locations were then filtered so that those with more than two Bars in radius of 250m and those with a Beer Bar closer than 400m were removed.\n\nThose location candidates were then clustered to create zones of interest which contain greatest number of location candidates. Addresses of centers of those zones were also generated using reverse geocoding to be used as markers/starting points for more detailed local analysis based on other factors.\n\nResult of all this is 15 zones containing largest number of potential new Bar locations based on number of and distance to existing venues - both Bars in general and Beer Bars particularly. This, of course, does not imply that those zones are actually optimal locations for a new Bar. Purpose of this analysis was to only provide info on areas close to Plaza \u00d1u\u00f1oa center but not crowded with existing Bars (particularly Beer ones) - it is entirely possible that there is a very good reason for small number of Bars in any of those areas (for example, that some of these areas are residential ones, and therefore not suitable for a Bar), reasons which would make them unsuitable for a new Bar regardless of lack of competition in the area. Recommended zones should therefore be considered only as a starting point for more detailed analysis which could eventually result in location which has not only no nearby competition but also other factors taken into account and all other relevant conditions met."
